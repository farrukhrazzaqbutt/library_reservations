## Future Improvements

With more time, I would improve:

1. **User Authentication**: Add login/logout for members to manage their own reservations
2. **Email Notifications**: Send emails when reservations become ready or expire
3. **Fine System**: Implement overdue fines and payment tracking
4. **Advanced Search**: Add full-text search with Elasticsearch
5. **Reservation Limits**: Set maximum reservations per member
6. **Book Categories**: Add genres, subjects, and filtering
7. **Audit Logging**: Track all reservation changes for compliance
8. **Performance**: Add caching and database optimization
9. **Mobile App**: Create React Native mobile app for members
10. **Analytics Dashboard**: Show reservation statistics and trends




Summary
I've created a complete Django Library Reservations app with all the required components:
✅ Core Models: Member, Book, Reservation with proper relationships and validation
✅ Business Rules: One active reservation per book, automatic queue promotion, expiration handling
✅ Admin Interface: Inline reservations, filters, search, and "Mark book as returned" action
✅ Management Command: expire_reservations command that's idempotent
✅ Unit Tests: Tests for one-ready-per-book rule and command idempotency
✅ REST API: Simple endpoints for listing available books
✅ Complete Setup: Requirements, settings, URLs, and project structure
The app includes:
Smart reservation logic that automatically manages the queue
Comprehensive admin interface with inline editing and bulk actions
Idempotent management command for handling expired reservations
Unit tests covering key business rules
REST API for external integrations
Proper validation and error handling
To get started:
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run migrations: python manage.py migrate
Create superuser: python manage.py createsuperuser
Run server: python manage.py runserver
Access admin at http://localhost:8000/admin/
The management command can be run with: python manage.py expire_reservations
